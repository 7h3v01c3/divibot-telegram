# Divibot - Telegram Divi Tipbot. Do Not Use In the Middle of UPDATE fork not updated yet 
 
#### Divi crypto currency tipbot for [Telegram](https://t.me/diviproject)


## Dependencies 

*  `apt-get install python3`
*  `apt-get install python3-pip
*  `pip3 install python-telegram-bot --upgrade`

* In order to run the tip-bot effectively, a Bitcoin-core based client is needed. For this git Divi-Core is used , but any major alternate crypto-currency client could easily be incorporated. 

## Setup

* Download the git
`git clone https://github.com/7h3v01c3/divibot-telegram`

* Setup a bot with the user @BotFather through PM on Telegram, after going through a setup you will be given a bot token. Edit the command.py file and replace the parameter 'BOT_TOKEN' with the one you just received. 

*  Run the script 
`python3 command.py`

*  Initiate the bot by inviting it to a chat or via PM, some commands are `/balance` , `/price` , `/help` and to find out the format related to tip others and withdrawal of funds use `/commands`.

### Setting up the bot as so still leaves the wallet unencrypted, so please go to extra measures to provide extra security. Make sure to have SSH encryption on whatever device/droplet you run it on. 

*  Please fork the code, happy tipping! 

This was designed originally for Reddcoin and is from Samgos/reddbot-telegram.

TheVoice (7h3v01c3) is mereley changing some minor details to match the DIVI core to use with DIVI telegram.
I am a Basher :) not a coder!

Thank you Samgos for putting this out in the world!
